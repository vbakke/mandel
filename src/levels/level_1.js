    <h3>Level 1 - Complex numbers</h3>
    <p>
        You probably already know this, but the Mandelbrot is based on <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">complex numbers</a></i>. 
    </p>                        
    <p>                        
        Complex numbers are one part normal number: for example: $<%=xStr%>$<br/>
        and one part an <i>imaginary number</i>*, for example: $1$  $i$. **
    </p>                        
    <p>                    
        The complex number is written as $-2 + 1i$, and we can draw this number in a coordinate system, just like  $x$, and $y$ <br/>
        $(x,y) = (-2, +1)$                        
    </p>
    <p>                    
        * $i$ is defined as $i = sqrt(-1)$ <br/>
        or as $i^2 = -1$
    </p>                        
    <p>                    
        ** $1$ $i$ is normally written just $i$, but I'll keep the number of $i$s explicit.
